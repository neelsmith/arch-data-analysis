## Course description

This course offers both a hands-on introduction to data analysis, and an introduction to the specific kinds of problems archaeologists study from the material remains of the human past. It is intended for students with no specific background other than curiosity about archaeology. We will learn a small amount of coding and statistical methods (less than you would cover in half a semester of an introductory statistics or programming class), along with fundamental principles of archaeology. This combination will enable you to make new discoveries about real archaeological data sets.

Course assignments will give you hands-on experience describing and characterizing large data sets, clustering and classifying data into meaningful interpretive groups, spatial analysis, network analysis, accounting for the complex ways archaeologists reconstruct chronological sequences, and integrating textual and archaeological data.
The skills you develop in this course can be directly applied to other historical, literary or social- science data sets.
