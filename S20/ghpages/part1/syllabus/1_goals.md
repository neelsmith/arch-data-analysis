title: "Archaeological Data Analysis, S'20"

---


## Goals  

In this course, you will become familiar with basic archaeological ideas about how material culture is created and preserved, what constitutes the archaeological record, and how we interpret it.  You will learn how to evaluate the contents of archaeological data sets from an archaeologist's perspective, taking into consideration what is absent from the data set, and what principles of selection or bias have influenced its creation. You will work with publicly available data sets from real archaeological projects to answer original, unsolved questions, and will present your work orally and on line.

You will gain practical experience working with real-world data, both born-digital material and data digitized from legacy print sources.  Among the computational methods you will apply are statistical summaries of data, classification, and spatial analyses such as proximity and density measurements and spatial clustering. You will develop data-science notebooks both to explore archaeological data, and to present your results with arguments backed up by code you have written, and supported by computer-generated visualizations.


## Objectives

Specific objectives include:

- using version control with `git`
- basic use of the `bash` shell
- writing short scripts in Scala
- using Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and publication
- basic geographic visualization and spatial analysis using QGIS

In addition, you will have the option of hosting a personal web site on github.
