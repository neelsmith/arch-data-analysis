title: "Analyzing Ptolemy's Geography"

Instructions will be posted here on Wed., March 25.


## Background

Ptolemy's *Geography* includes locations in longitude-latitude coordinates for more than 6,000 points.  How can we evaluate the accuracy of his spatial data?

While his scheme of longitude and latitude is the same one we use -- 360 degrees of longitude measured from an arbitrary 0 (the *origin*), and 360 degrees of latitude with 0 at the equator, running to 90 degrees North and 90 degrees south at the poles -- his raw data do not fall near the corresponding modern locations.  In this analysis, you will:

1. Download a data set with Ptolemy's raw data
2. Adjust its scale
3. Determine an appropriate origin of longitude
4. Adjust latitude to fit his base line for measuring latitude.
