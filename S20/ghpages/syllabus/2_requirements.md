## Course requirements and grading

Course grades will be determined by specification grading, an assessment system in which assignments are graded on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory scale according to a previously circulated rubric.  One aim of specification grading is to give you control over your grades. Grades are not arbitrarily assigned â€“ they are earned by the work that you do. Further, you get to decide how much time and energy you want to commit to the course in order to achieve the grade you desire.
