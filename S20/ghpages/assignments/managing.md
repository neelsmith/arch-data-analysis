## Before coming to class


### Reading

Review your notes from discussion in our first class, and read:

1.  pp. 11-15 in Renfrew and Bahn, *Archaeology Essentials*
2.  the nine "Principles of Archaeological Ethics" defined by the Society for American Archaeology (online [here](https://www.saa.org/career-practice/ethics-in-professional-archaeology)).

How do these nine principles derive from the specific nature of archaeology?



### Prepare your computer


Download and install these three fundamental applications:

- a hackable text editor: Atom <https://atom.io/>
- bash shell:
    - OS X: use the Terminal app in the Applications/Utilities folder
    - Windows:  gitbash comes with the Windows installation of git <https://git-scm.com/>
- version control: git <https://git-scm.com/>


**Bring your laptop with this software installed to class**. (If you have any issues with installing the software, we can review them in class.)
