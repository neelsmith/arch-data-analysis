## Before coming to class

Download and install these three fundamental applications:

- a hackable text editor: Atom <https://atom.io/>
- bash shell:
    - OS X: use the Terminal app in the Applications/Utilities folder
    - Windows:  gitbash comes with the Windows installation of git <https://git-scm.com/>
- version control: git <https://git-scm.com/>


**Bring your laptop with this software installed to class**. (If you have any issues with installing the software, we can review them in class.)
