title: "The Roman Imperial Coinage data set"
---


In today's class, we will work through the first lab assignment.  (See [these instructions](http://shot.holycross.edu/courses/ada/S20/labs/module1/).)

In brief, you will:

- complete the incoimplete parts of a Jupyter analyzing Roman imperial coin issues

The questions we will address are the same kinds of questions you will ask about every collection of data:

- how are records organized: what properties are recorded for each object?
- what values do we find for each property?  How many distinct values occur, and how frequently?
- are there missing values or data, or identifiable errors?  
- can we determine where errors come from? are they errors in digitizing a print source, do they result from inconsistency in a print source, or errors in editorial judgment?
