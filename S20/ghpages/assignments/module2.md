title: "Distribution of Attic painted pottery"

You can find a delimited text file with a current composite of your classmate's contributions to a set of vase distributions [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neelsmith/clas299/master/vases-2020.cex).

Download it, and load it as a delimited-text file in QGIS.  It uses `#` as a delimiter: be sure to specify that when you import the file into QGIS.  (Since many of the descriptions of subjects include commas, you won't get a usable result if you just globally change `#` to a comma.)

Compare the distribution of these Pioneer Group-painters to:

- early black figure
- later 5th-century red-figure vases


You should compose a brief discussion of your comparison in markdown format in a file you commit to your github repository.  (Name it something with no white space, and ending in `.md` extension.)  Your discussion should


- include one or more illustrative maps.  (Recall that you can export an image of the currently displayed map in QGIS by using the Project menu, `Import/export... Export map to Image...`)
- take account of limitations of the data set you're using to support your interpretation.  How many examples does it cover?  How many were rejected?  How reliably consistent are values for vase painter?
