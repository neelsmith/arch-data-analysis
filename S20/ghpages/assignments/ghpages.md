title: "Building a web site with github pages"
---

I'll take part of our group Google Meet to present an overview of the second part of the course.  In lieu of oral presentations of one or more pieces of work this semester, we'll put together a web site, hosted on github.  

Before coming to class:

- please [watch this video](http://shot.holycross.edu/courses/ada/S20/videos/ghpages.mp4).
- have a go at setting up an initial web site before Tuesday's class.
