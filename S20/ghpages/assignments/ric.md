Read selection from Andrew Burnett, "Circulation and function" (chapter 5 of Andrew Burnett, *Coinage in the Roman World*), available on Moodle.

Skim Chapter 7 of Renfrew and Bahn, "How Were Artifacts Made, Used and Distributed?"  How do the ideas introduced in this chapter in this chapter apply to coins?

- are there distinctive aspects of *how* coins were made?
- how do the *materials* coins are made from tell us about their original function?  How might they affect the survival of coins in the archaeological record?
- how should we think about the *spatial distribution* of coins? How do find spot and place of manufacture relate?
- one distinctive feature of coins is the explicit identification (through text and/or visual imagery) of the issuing authority.  How is that important for understanding the function of these artifacts?
