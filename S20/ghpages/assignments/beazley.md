## Approaches to studying Greek painted pottery


What kinds of questions can we ask about painted pottery?  What observations enable us to answer different kinds of questions?  To get a sense of the range of possibilities, please read:

- in chapter 7 of Renfrew and Bahn, the section on "Trade and Exchange" (pp. 217-231).
- on Moodle, the paired essays "Looking at Greek vases" by Martin Robertson and Mary Beard.

We will begin working this week with the massive lists attributing particular vases to individual painters published in print form by John Beazley.  We'll focus in particular on a crucial moment in the history of Athenian pottery production:  the work of what Beazley dubbed the "Pioneer Group" of red-figure painters at the end of the sixth century BCE.  You'll find a scan of Beazley's lists for the Pioneer Group on Moodle


We'll look at his lists in class, but before we do, think about what kinds of questions we could ask using the information they include.  In addition to his attribution and the identification of the object, Beazley lists the shape, its find spot (if known), and the subject(s) of the painted decoration. He normally provides an approximate chronology in his discussion of the painter, rather than individually for each vase.  Could a large-scale collection of this information be used to address any of the questions Renfrew and Bahn are interested in?
