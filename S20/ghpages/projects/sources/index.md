Once we have agreed on a topic, I can help you find appropriate sources.  We are constrained by the kinds of material that survive and the kinds of material that are accessible to us.  

For example, it would be revealing to compare the information in the OCRE data set we used early in the semester with information from Roman imperial coin hoards -- but we have no compilation comparable to the *Inventory of Greek Coin Hoards* or the *Roman Republican Coin Hoards*.

If your project requires compiling digital versions of data from print sources, we want to make sure that we plan appropriate time for that.
