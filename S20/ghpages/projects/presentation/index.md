Your final project should be presented from a website hosted on github showcasing a portfolio of one or more examples of your digital work. Your presentation should:

1. explain your project clearly to a non-specialist audience.  You should be able to share this web site with a friend or family member.
2. support replicating your work.  This includes:
    - making the data set that you used available
    - sharing any computational analysis (e.g., in a Jupyter notebook)
