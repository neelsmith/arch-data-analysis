> Topics for self-designed projects define a limited, open research question that you can address from a publicly available data set.


You might wish to extend the work you did on one of the group exercises in some way, or you might have other ideas about topics you would like to explore.  For a topic to be approved, it must:

- pose a question you can answer from an accessible data set.
- be reasonable to complete by the final due date (May 6)

I can help you try to find a suitable topic.  Start with *something* you're interested in - a kind of question, a particular source - and I can meet with you to talk through possibilities.

Once your topic has been approved, **you may find you need to modify it** as you begin to work with your sources.  This is probably a sign of progress!  Just clear it with me as you go along.
