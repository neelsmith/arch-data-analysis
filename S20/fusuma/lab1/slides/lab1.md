##  An archaeological question

> How frequently did different Roman emperors issue coins?

---


## Modelling as fundamental scholarly work

- How do we model an *issue* of Roman coins? (data structure)
- How do we measure frequency? (algorithm)

---

## Glimpse ahead

Next week:  designing digital model for production of Greek painted pottery

---

## Data structures

- Ordered collections (Scala `Vector`)
- Key / value pairings (Scala `Map`)
- Group of unique values (Scala `Set`)


---

## Algorithm

- define a rate of frequency, e.g., *yearly*
- find number of issues per emperor
- find number of years per emperor
- divide each emperor's count of issues by number of years

---

## Mechanics


1. Answer questions by completing Scala notebook
2. `Download as...` / 'Notebook (.ipynb)', save to your computer
3.  Add saved notebook file to your github repository


---

## Your github repository

If you have not yet:

-  given me your github name
-  created a `clas299` repository

> do it now.

---

## Consider please

- giving my write permission to your `clas299` repository (only)
- `Settings` / `Collaborators` : github name `neelsmith`

---

## New Scala idea: `groupBy`


See [introductory notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neelsmith/scala-intro-ipynb/master?filepath=nbs%2Fgroupby.ipynb)

## Completing [lab 1](http://shot.holycross.edu/courses/ada/S20/labs/module1/)


- check yourself with others in class
