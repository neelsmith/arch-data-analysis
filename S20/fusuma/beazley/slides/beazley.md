## Follow-up from last time



- Complete submission for credit: when I can run your notebook from `mybinder.org` [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nadimattia/clas299/master)
- Courtesy request:  build your notebook on `mybinder.org` before I try to run it
- New Jupyter notebook on [plotting bar charts](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/neelsmith/scala-intro-ipynb/master?filepath=nbs%2Fplotting-bar-charts.ipynb)
- Learn enough `git` to update/add new notebooks to your repository

## One-time set up for your computer

## One-time set up for each repository

- (optional: check you're where you want to be: `pwd`)
- `git clone REPOSITORY_URL`

And if you want to start working: `cd REPOSITORY_NAME`

(e.g., `cd clas299`)

## Regular work pattern

- `git pull`

## Ted Underwood tweet, "My First Book Report on Computers"


#### In conclusion, there are many fun things we can do with computers.

#### It only takes work—specifically,

### **a bottomless abyss of ceaseless detail work that you never thought possible in your worst nightmares**.
